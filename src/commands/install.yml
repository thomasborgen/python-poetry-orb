  The install command reads the pyproject.toml file from the current project, resolves the dependencies, and installs them.
  If there is a `poetry.lock` file in the current directory, it will use the exact versions from there instead of resolving them.
  This ensures that everyone using the library will get the same versions of the dependencies.
